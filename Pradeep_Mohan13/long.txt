Suppose the answer to this question is Hen,
then there will be another confusion whether Hen came first or Rooster.
Because for a hen to hatch an egg we need both the Hen and Rooster. So to make it it clean we will accept the fact as many of the scientist suggest that the egg came first. 

Amniotic eggs were a big deal. They opened up a whole new world of opportunities for land-based egg-laying locations, and the extra membranes paved the way for bigger (and mostly better) eggs.
We’re still not sure of exactly when this happened, largely because eggy membranes don’t make very good fossils, leaving scientists with no clear record of when, or how, amniotic eggs developed.
Our best guess is that the last common ancestor of both tetrapods (four-limbed animals with a backbone) and the amniotes (four-limbed animals with a backbone that lay eggs with all those extra layers)
lived around 370-340 million years ago, though some sources put the first amniote species as living closer to 312 million years ago. Today’s mammals, reptiles and birds are all descendants. of the first amniotes.
